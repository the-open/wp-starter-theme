# OPEN Generic Wordpress Theme

Based on Sage 9.0.0-beta. See [https://github.com/roots/sage](https://github.com/roots/sage) for setup instructions.

*Note: This repository only contains a theme. You'll need to load it up inside an actual wordpress site.*

## Theme development

* Run `yarn` from the theme directory to install dependencies
* Update `resources/assets/config.json` settings:

### Build commands
